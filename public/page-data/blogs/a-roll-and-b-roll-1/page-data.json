While it’s possibly the easiest and most fundamental distinction you’ll ever make, there is a big difference between how each one functions in video production.\nA-Roll and B-Roll are terms from the old days of linear film editing, when editors would use two rolls of identical footage — an actual A-Roll and a B-Roll — to create transitions between shots.\n\n### A-Roll ###\n\n>A great way to think of A-Roll is media that “tells” the story, such as an interview or a news segment. It’s the primary audio and video that often consists of one or more people discussing a topic or relating a narrative. A-Roll is the driving media in most documentaries, news broadcasts, talk shows, and reality shows.\n\n### B-Roll ###\n\n>B-Roll is supplemental footage used to visually support the A-Roll. Think of it as video that “shows” the story. If the A-Roll narrative talks about residences, then the B-Roll might show a house. It just needs to complement, and if possible, confirm the story told by the A-Roll media. Using B-Roll footage helps break up the monotony of a common A-Roll interview shot, making the whole thing much more engaging.\n\n\n\n\n","title":" A-Roll and B-Roll","desc":"The Two Types of Footage You Need to Tell a Great St"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-roll-and-b-roll-1"}}}
